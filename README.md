"LoTrix" - Lofi Matrix Effect

Decided to make this fun little thing just to learn a bit of C++ and Raylib.
Still a noob at it but I will get there (eventually).
Font made by me.

- It takes 4 arguments atm:
    ./LoTrix [width] [height] [max_amount] [rainbow] ---> Default is false (can only be set to true).
                 \       \          \_.-> Default is the highest value between width and height divided by 4 (128 / 4 = 32).
                  '-------'---> Default is 128x128.
- Keybinds:
    KEY_SPACE/KEY_P ---> Pause/unpause.
    KEY_F -------------> Toggle fullscreen.
```
