"LoTrix" - Lofi Matrix Effect

Decided to make this fun little thing just to learn a bit of C++ and Raylib.
Still a noob at it but I will get there (eventually).
Font made by me.

It takes 3 arguments atm:
    ./LoTrix [amount] [rainbow] [size] ---> Default is 128.
                |         \_.-> Default is false (can only be set to true).
                '-> Default is [size] / 4 (32).
